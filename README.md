# Thoughts
A journal as I study and pursue personal projects. Maybe someday in the future I'll be ready for a real blog. In the mean time, this keeps my thoughts flowing and my basic git skills fresh.

## Current Projects
I'm studying Ruby on Rails through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails). While undertaking this, I'm trying out [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) as a project/course tracker (and whatever else it may grow into naturally). 

## Future Projects
- Many Salesforce certs, may Salesforce trailhead badges.
- Finish [WYWM's data pathway](https://withyouwithme.com/career-pathways/data-pathway/)
- [ISTQB CTFL](https://www.istqb.org/certifications/certified-tester-foundation-level-ctfl-v4-0/)
- Many books through [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/books)
- Testing For Beginners from [Ruby Monday Study Group](https://rubymonstas.org/)
- The entirety of the math curriculum on [Khan Academy](https://en.khanacademy.org/)

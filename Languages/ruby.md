## Whitespace
Multiple sources from the Ruby course I'm on tell me to use tab as 2 spaces. Not as tabs, not as 4 or 6 or 8 spaces. Which had me wondering why. I tend to favor 4 spaces up to this point because I've found it the easiest to identify indentations without excessive white space. Is white space significant in Ruby like it is in Python? (I haven't read any Ruby beyond hello world at this point.) But from the 4 sources (just different sites with conversations), it's just convention for consistency and possibly to allow readable deeper nesting. I was directed to the unofficial guide at [caliban.org](https://caliban.org/ruby/rubyguide.shtml#indentation).

## Snake Case
I don't recall learning snake case before now. It is certainly more readable, particularly when involving acronyms. Camel casing and pascal casing with acronymns is a nightmare. I've worked around them by (a) avaoiding them, then (b) using underscores around them. But that's inconsistent. Perhaps I'll favor snake case outside of Ruby too.

## The Odin Project: Ruby Course

## Introduction to Programming with Ruby by Launch School
https://launchschool.com/books/ruby

The introduction of this book is part of the reading from The Odin Project. If I want to reitterate what I'm learning through The Odin Project, this appears to be a good source. They have other books covering topics like SQL, Agile, and Regular Expressions. I'll add these books to my ever-growing future projects list.

The Preparations chapter is also part of the reading from The Odin Project. 

## Ruby Monday Study Group curriculum for beginners

The tools of this curriculum is part of the reading from The Odin Project. It's another avenue for reitteration. They also have a testing for beginners path, which I'll be adding to my, again, ever-growing future projects list.

The most interesting part of the tools section for me was IRB. It gave me a simple try-something-new joy, which is important for me to keep the learning momentum going.

Currently trying out the features as a way to track my online studying.

### Find
While consuming the Ruby course introduction readings, I accidentally discovered Ctrl + / opens find. I'm used to using Ctrl + k to do so in tools like Slack. Opening find features from keyboard shortcuts is one of my preferred methods of interact with multiple threads of information, so this was plesant to find early without searching for it specifically.

### To-Dos
First impression when trying out the to-dos was uncertainty around the lack of subtask/sublists. I enjoy nesting my tasks, particularly if I think I can't do an individual item in one day. Checking my way through a list is a quick way for me to get back in the flow. Discreet units of work with an area to write notes is my comfort zone.

I'm working around that uncertainty by making the parent task the list itself, then the subtasks the items within the list. Seems to being working fine for my current use case. Discovered the card view quickly and am humming-and-hawwing on my prefered view. Color-me-in is also a lovely touch. It almost side-tracked me from my main goal.

#### Issues
 I have only one real and persistant complaint (though small): every time I add a new list, it's always added to the top. Because I'm working around the lack of subtasks, I'm adding tasks in order of operation. Every time I add a list, I have to drag it to the bottom to keep it in the "correct order." I wish I had the option to just make the list at the bottom. On the flip side, I can see that option being less popular and potentially clutter-y for the page. I genunely love how simple the view is and wouldn't want to disrupt that without a very good reason. 
 
 Thinking through this as I type this out, a feature that could make this less painful and would likely be more popular/useful is a new *vew as* option. An option that shows the lists condensed to their list title. Re-ordering would be quicker, I wouldn't be as overwhelmed by how long my list of lists is (whether it's list or card mode). If I could add anything to the roadmap for to-dos, I think it would be the condensed list-title only view. It is entirely possible this feature exists and either (a) I don't have access on the free version or (b) I just haven't found it yet.

 I've surprised myself by wishing more for a condensed task list view over the ability to subtask.
